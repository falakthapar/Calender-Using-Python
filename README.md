##  Python Programming Project - Publish Calendar for a Year of choice
### Overview :
* The overall project has been broken down into smaller steps. Solving for all of these Steps in the given sequence will ultimately form the overall project
* <font color='blue'>**I have tried to explain each steps, I went through in order to get the calender on any entered year.**</font>
* <font color='red'>**I have used basic dictionary and list operations and have not made use of calender module.**</font>
* I have made use of the Google Colab notebooks in order to make this project.
* I have tried my code on mutiple years<font color='red'>(>1600, as I have considered year 1600 as my reference year)</font> and cross checked them with that year calender, I have considered leap years.
* Please run all the cells one by one in order to see the steps I have used and at end you will get an option to print the calender of any year in one step.
